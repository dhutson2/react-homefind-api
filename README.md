Homefind is an app that will let you search through previous MLS listings to find a home, based off of your specified criteria.

The data comes from a series of API calls to Bridge Interactive's database. This particular database has a couple of stipulations:

    1. The only available data is from previous listings that are no longer available.
    2. There are only 10,000 possible homes that you can search for.
    3. The homes are confined to a specific area.

To prevent confusion, the app will randomly search through all available zip codes (based in California) to find a home that meets your specified criteria.

Future functionality would come if the realtime MLS database becomes available and would include:

    1. The ability to view a specific home and more details on it
    2. Expanded ability to specify any zip code
    3. Ability to save houses as favorites to view later
